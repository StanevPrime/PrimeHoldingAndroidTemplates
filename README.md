# Description
Prime Holding's templates allow you to:

[Configure New Application](Documentation/ProjectTemplate.md)

[Create new screen -- Activity and View Model](Documentation/ActivityTemplate.md)

[Create new View Model](Documentation/ViewModel.md)

# Installation

1. Copy the contents of the repository to a new folder in your Android Studio templates folder, which would usually be
C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\
2. Restart Android Studio (**File -> Invalidate Caches/ Restart -> Just Restart**)
The expected result should be this:

**All templates are in Kotlin only and use the AndroidX libraries.**


# Known Issues
Each time Android Studio updates, it will display a prompt for you to delete any Templates you have previously added. Proceed and delete them, then re-add them.
