##  Description
There are cases when the View Model gets too big and this is when we have to separate the functionality into independent View Models. This template generates an empty View Model that can be used for such purposes.
## Usage
1. Go to New -> Prime -> View Model

1. Select your View Model name (excluding the *ViewModel* part of the title) and press Finish

1. Done! The following file will be generated:
    ![Alt text](Images/ViewModel_Result.png?raw=true "Result View Model")
